# (hashing *)

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/weinholt/hashing.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/weinholt/hashing)

This is a collection of R6RS libraries for hashing (checksums,
message digests, etc).

They have been extracted from Industria by an extensive git
filter-branch operation.

The libraries have no dependencies. The tests require SRFI 13, SRFI
14, SRFI 64 and SRFI 78.
