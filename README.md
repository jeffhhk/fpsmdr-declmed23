# Instructions

## Prerequisites

Tested with software versions:
- Python 3.7.9
- Chez Scheme 9.5

To run the demo application, you will need to obtain a copy of RTX-KG2c version 7.6.  The redistribution license terms of RTX-KG2c (in the words of its authors) are [It's complicated](https://github.com/RTXteam/RTX-KG2#what-licenses-cover-kg2).  Unfortunately, they currently have not posted a new enough version of this particular artifact to be suitabl for the demo.  Contact the author to arrange access: jeff at groovescale dot com.

## Setup

Clone this repository.  Make the local repository your current directory.

Obtain rtx-kg2c_7.6.tar.gz and copy to dagopoly-py/storage/exogenous/

## Demonstration 1 - minimal Python application
